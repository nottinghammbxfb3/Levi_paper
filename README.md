## Code used in paper.

### A.
#### Code to filter VCF:
python fastStructure_vcf_generation_diversity.py -i input.vcf -o output_10kbthin_20PMD_min2pctMAF.vcf -r C_excelsa_V5.fa.masked.fa.fai -g 10000 -f 0.02 -m 0.2

### B. 
The cohort was generated by selecting rows based on presence of matching strings in R. PCA was performed using all individuals from the selected cohort using “glPcaFast” from “Easy_adegenet_script_and_modified_functions.R”, which was then manually filtered to remove the corrupt individuals based on position in the PCA relative to the expected position, producing the final selected cohort of 29 samples for all downstream analyses (Table 1).

### C. 
Neighbour joining trees from distance based analyses were created using “adegenet_Ana_version.R” lines 403 – 517.

### D. 
Allele frequency spectra were created using “AFS.R”.
